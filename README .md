# BikeSharing
> You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. 
>It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. 
>They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
>Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
The factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know: Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes? How well those variables describe the bike demands?

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- 2019 has the more bike usage compared to 2018.
- LowRainandSnow and MistandCloudy the lower bike due to climate scenerios
- Spring and Winter has the hard the climate so lower bike usage
- July has high temperature and Sep, Mar of spring or snow seasons
